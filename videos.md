## Lists and Keys

### [Watch Me](https://vimeo.com/223236338)

	
1. Display array ```groceries``` as a list just like the picture. Use classes ```GroceryItem``` and ```ShoppingCart``` in a way that makes sense; use the item names as keys.

1. Display array ```roster``` as a nested list, as in the picture. Use the provided classes in a way that makes sense - make sure that you use keys for both mappings, and that the keys are unique!

1. Create a React Form that enforces validation on the email and password fields. The email must have at least 3 characters before the '@' and the password must have a minimum of 4 characters that contain at least 1 number and at least 1 letter.


## State, Lifecycle Hooks

1. In the Codepen below utilize the correct lifecycle hook and ajax to grab data (using ajax GET) from URL: https://api.myjson.com/bins/rztih .

1. A local Squirrel sleeps or wakes up whenever it is poked. While it is awake, it collects nuts to survive. You are given a function, ```gather```, as a prop. Using only lifecycle functions and a timer, make it so that the Squirrel component only "gathers" nuts while it is awake (the Squirrel component is mounted when woken and unmounted when asleep).

Replace the commented pieces of code in each of the snippets below to no longer cause a mutation of `myVar`. Do so without changing the output of the program.


Note: The official MDN documentation for [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) has a handy list of available functions on the left sidebar.


1. Adding to an array
    ```javascript
      var myVar = [1, 2, 3];

      myVar.push(4); // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
1. Removing from the end of an array
    ```javascript
      var myVar = [1, 2, 3];

      myVar.pop(); // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: [1, 2]
    ```
1. Removing from the middle of an array
    ```javascript
      var myVar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

      myVar.splice(2, 1); // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
    ```
1. Changing each entry in an array
    ```javascript
      var myVar = [1, 2, 3];

      for (var i = 0; i < myVar.length; i++) {
        myVar[i] = myVar[i] * 10
      } // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: [10, 20, 30]
    ```
1. Array of arrays (2D array)
    ```javascript
      // Be careful not to mutate the outer array
      // OR any of the inner arrays
      var myVar = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 0, 6],
        [7, 8, 9]
      ];

      myVar[1][1] = 5; // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: [
      //  [1, 2, 3],
      //  [4, 5, 6],
      //  [7, 8, 9]
      // ]
    ```
1. Add/change an object key
    ```javascript
      var myVar = { a: 10, b: 15 };

      myVar.b = 20; // Mutation
      myVar.c = 30; // Mutation

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: { a: 10, b: 20 , c: 30 }
    ```
1. Remove an object key
    ```javascript
      // This one might be tricky
      var myVar = { a: 10, b: 15 };

      delete myVar.b;

      console.log(myVar);
      // Output: { a: 10 }
    ```
